    capacity_factor_notes: |
      Battery storage capacity factor fundamentally differs from generation CF:
      - Bidirectional operation requires separate charge/discharge metrics
      - High CF can indicate grid services (FCESS) rather than energy arbitrage
      - Should analyze alongside dispatch-weighted prices for revenue implications
      - Round-trip efficiency degrades over time (aging analysis)

    capacity_factor_notes: |
      Thermal CF interpretation depends on role:
      - Baseload: target CF ~85-95%
      - Mid-merit: CF ~40-60%
      - Peaking: CF <20%, high $/MWh focus
      
      Renewable CF is weather-dependent:
      - Expected CF varies by season and technology
      - Actual vs expected CF indicates performance issues
      - Curtailment: physical CF > market CF
